IPis a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services suchas end-to-end security, quality of service (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 addressspace reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processingby border routers at network edges. Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IPaddresses.

WAAS Express is a cost-effective, IOS-based, WAN optimization solutionthat increases the amount of available bandwidth for small-to-mid-size branch offices and remotelocations, while accelerating TCP-based applications that operate in a WAN environment. The Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express software optimizes TCP traffic flows acrossa WAN. WAAS Express integrates with native services such as security, NetFlow, and quality ofservice (QoS). WAAS Express provides the following benefits: Bandwidth optimization Application acceleration Increase in remote user productivity Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure Network transparency Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.

Defect filing in CDETSLANGUAGE TCL Programming, PythonRELEASES LANCER, PHOENIX, SKYHAWK, SPRITDESCRIPTION Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves theperformance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide AreaFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally atLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-basedapplications on a given network. WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that worktogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attemptto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs sothat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether tooptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platformcheck.PRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)EDUCATIONB.E in CSEANNA University2011Day Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School2005 to 2007SKILLSoptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONTechnical SkillsProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#Concepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),WCCP Protocol,Automation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing FrameworkIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]SoftwareEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),TIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product LifecycleManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)Operating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux", "entities": [[0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [277, 295, "SOFTWARE"], [337, 344, "SOFTWARE"], [346, 367, "SOFTWARE"], [277, 285, "SOFTWARE"], [337, 344, "SOFTWARE"], [346, 367, "SOFTWARE"], [616, 619, "SOFTWARE"], [337, 344, "SOFTWARE"], [346, 367, "SOFTWARE"], [188, 209, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [41, 51, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [223, 233, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [235, 241, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [246, 252, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [331, 336, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [616, 631, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [301, 307, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [1541, 1544, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [1966, 1977, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2304, 2308, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2325, 2329, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2378, 2395, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2409, 2430, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2484, 2500, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [2647, 2672, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2739, 2766, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2786, 2800, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2863, 2881, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3010, 3044, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [2717, 2734, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2869, 2881, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2838, 2855, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2969, 2981, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [2304, 2308, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [3221, 3234, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3771, 3782, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3784, 3788, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3790, 3795, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3797, 3800, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [3802, 3818, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [8072, 8076, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [277, 295, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [301, 307, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [301, 307, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [346, 353, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [337, 344, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [277, 285, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [346, 353, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [337, 344, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [337, 344, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [346, 367, "TECH_KNOWLEDGE"], [0, 0, ""], [616, 619, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [616, 619, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [0, 0, ""], [301, 307, "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE"]]}, {"content": "Yathishwaran PMaximo Consultant - Infosys LimitedNamakkal, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yathishwaran-P/a9c8d42210af40b8 Maximo Consultant in Infosys Limited, Chennai from August 2013 till date (around 4.8 years) IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMOApplication.
